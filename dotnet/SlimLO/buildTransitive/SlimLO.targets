    Native asset copying is handled by SlimLO.NativeAssets.{Platform} packages.
    Each platform package includes its own .targets file that copies native
    libraries, worker executable, UNO registries, and share/ resources to
    the output directory.

    Install the appropriate package for your target platform:
      dotnet add package SlimLO.NativeAssets.Linux
      dotnet add package SlimLO.NativeAssets.macOS
      dotnet add package SlimLO.NativeAssets.Win32      (future)
  -->
</Project>
